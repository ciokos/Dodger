The project consists of two smaller ones.
One is for creating a classifier with a web friendly, easy ml5 library. It can be used to teach the program to recognize positions of for example hands to stear in the game.
The other is the actual very simple game. A little circle at the bottom moving left, right or staying in place in order to avoid bullets.
